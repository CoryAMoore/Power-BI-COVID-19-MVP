This Power BI report tracks dailyÂ COVID-19 Coronavirus trends using data from the CDC curated by Johns Hopkins University. 

Please feel free to make enhancements or use this in any capacity that will help the community, clients, etc.
If you or other data professionals can collaborate to expand this project, please do so.
If you make any changes that would break the data model or existing report pages, please save a new file and provide comments. Power BI doesn't doesn't naturally support versioning and change-merging so please try to leave existing features in-place and make additions that can be incrementally and manually added to a master copy.
